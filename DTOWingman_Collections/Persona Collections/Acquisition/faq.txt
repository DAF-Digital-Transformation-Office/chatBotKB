Q: How will projects be funded?
A: Many of the projects we’re focused on are already funded through their respective organizations—we’re simply helping them optimize and connect with one another. In cases where projects have high potential to scale and make a significant impact in achieving Department-wide objectives, DTO matching investments may be available. The DTO and other digital champions will continue to pursue and secure funding for enterprise-wide digital enablers.

Q: How can external partners get involved in this initiative?
A: We’re eager to engage current and potential partners as we build out this initiative, and will share more information on opportunities for collaboration in the coming weeks. To learn more visit daftdto.com/get-involved.

Q: What are the Digital Engineering features used for? 
A: Acquisitions that would like to use digital engineering need to identify the features that meet their overall acquisition objectives.  From the acquisition’s digital engineering modeling objectives the needed DE features are selected along with their feature choices.  The DE features and feature choices are used to determine the SOW/PWS inputs and standards to put on contract as well as the CDRLs/DIDs. 

Q: Why aren’t complete SOW/PWS templates provided as a part of this guidance? 
A: Each acquisition develops its own unique requirements which, in part, would contain digital engineering features as applicable to that program.  To develop an entire template SOW/PWS would be impracticable given the fact that all programs would not have identical requirements (digital engineering related, or otherwise).  Instead, this guidance seeks to provide a “critical thinking” path for inclusion of just the applicable digital engineering features and their associated SOW/PWS language that would be included in that program’s overall requirements determination. 

Q: Will corresponding Data Item Descriptions (DIDs) and Contract Data Requirement Lists (CDRLs) be included in this guidance?   
A: Absolutely, we fully intend to add an additional tab which maps applicable DIDs/CDRLs to each feature.  This research/development is being accomplished by a different LOE team, so we currently don’t have any DE specific DIDs/CDRLs to populate this tab.  In the meantime we have provided guidance in the form of a slide deck that addresses the current situation with regard to that development. (Reference “DE Features and CDRLs Alignment (23 Feb 2021)” https://usaf.dps.mil/teams/afmcde/SitePages/Model-based-Contract-Language.aspx 

Q: Will digital engineering related contract clauses be included in this guidance? 
A: At this point the AFMC Digital Campaign team reviewing policy impacts has not identified any specific need for unique DE-related clauses, but should something like that be created, then we would definitely map such a clause within this matrix. 

Q: Will there be inclusion of associated engineering technical content in this guidance? 
A: While some technical content will be in the SOW/PWS (and also in DIDs/CDRLs), keep in mind that program specific technical content is unique to any RFP development.  Recognizing that it would be helpful to have additional engineering input to enhance our matrix, we will continue to seek ways to add applicable content as it is made available.

The virtual machine is sandboxed from the rest of the system, meaning that the software inside a virtual machine can’t escape or tamper with the computer itself. This produces an ideal environment for testing other operating systems including beta releases, accessing virus-infected data, creating operating system backups, and running software or applications on operating systems they weren’t originally intended for; Source: Azure: What is a virtual machine?
